        <br><h2>WHY READ BOOKS WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO DO?</h2>
        <p><br>
          Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us
          endless knowledge and lessons while keeping our minds active. Books
          can hold and keep all kinds of information, stories, thoughts and
          feelings unlike anything else in this world. The importance of a book
          to help us learn and understand things cannot be underestimated. Can
          words, paragraphs, and fictional worlds be all that great for you and
          your health? It definitely can, and reading is a timeless form of
          entertainment and information.
          Reading develops language skills and vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce stress. It is important to read a good book at least for a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning. In fact, for years reading was the only
          form of personal entertainment, and perhaps this is why reading has
          been in the spotlight for such a long time. Reading has survived the
          years, and luckily, the benefits have survived right along with the
          books. So let’s talk about some reasons why reading is so important.
          <br>
          <br><h2>SOME AMAZING BENEFITS OF READING BOOKS</h2>
          <ul><br>
            <li><h4>Reading exercises our brain</h4>
              Reading is a much more complex task for the human brain rather than watching TV, for example. Reading strengthens brains connections and builds new connections.</li>
            <li><h4>Reading Reduces Stress</h4>
              Reading a good book takes you in a new world and helps you relieve your day to day stress. It has several positive effects on your mind, body, and soul. It stimulates your brain muscles and keeps your brain healthy and strong.</li>
            <li><h4>Reading Boosts your Imagination and Creativity</h4>
              Through reading a variety of books people learn about people, places, and events outside of their own experience. It makes you think creatively, fantasize and use your imagination.</li>
            <li><h4>Reading develops a child's imagination</h4>
              As we read our brains translate the descriptions we read of people, places and things into pictures. While we are engaged in a story we are also imagining how a character is feeling.</li>
            <li><h4>Reading is a fun activity</h4>
              A book or an e-reader doesn't take up much space and is light to carry, so you take it anywhere so you can never be bored if you have a book in your bag.</li>
          </ul>

          <br><h2>CONCLUSION</h>
          <p><br>
            The habit of reading is one of the best qualities that a person can possess. Books are known to be your best friend for a reason. So it is very important to develop a good reading habit. We must all read on a daily basis for at least 30 minutes to enjoy the sweet fruits of reading. It is a great pleasure to sit in a quiet place and enjoy reading. Reading a good book is the most enjoyable experience one can have.

            In this website I've divided these main categories into 2 broad categories:
            <ol>
              <li>Fiction</li>
              <li>Non-Fiction</li>
            </ol>

            <br><h3>What Is the Difference Between Fiction and Nonfiction?</h3>
            <p>
              Literary works of fiction are works that aren’t based on true facts. Typically fiction appears as narrative—think of great novels by the likes of Mark Twain, Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Edgar Allen Poe, and more. <br>
              In addition to novels, fiction can appear as short stories, poetry, and in theatrical scripts for film, television, and live performance. <br>
              In a nutshell, nonfiction covers everything else. The contents of nonfiction are rooted in true events, although many nonfiction books offer strongly opinionated commentary on those true events—think of authors like George Will, Paul Krugman, Frank Rich, and more.
