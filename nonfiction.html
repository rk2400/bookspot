      Nonfiction is a broad genre of writing that encompasses all books that aren’t rooted in a fictional narrative.
      Nonfiction writing can be based in history and biography, it can be instructional, it can offer commentary and humor, and it can ponder philosophical questions.
      If a book is not rooted in a made-up story, then it is nonfiction.

              <h3>Shoe Dog: A Memoir by Phil Knight</h3>
            <p>In 1962, fresh out of business school, phil knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from japan. Selling the shoes from the boot of his Plymouth, knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today, nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of start-ups, nike is the ne plus ultra of all start-ups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognisable symbols in the world today. But knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, he tells his story. A memoir rich with insight, humour and hard-won wisdom, this book is also studded with lessons - about building something from scratch, overcoming adversity, and ultimately leaving your mark on the world.

            <p>
              For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare -- poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights.

The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him "The Fittest (Real) Man in America."

              <h3>Man's Search For Meaning By Viktor Frankl</h3>
            <p>
              A prominent Viennese psychiatrist before the war, Viktor Frankl was uniquely able to observe the way that he and other inmates coped with the experience of being in Auschwitz. He noticed that it was the men who comforted others and who gave away their last piece of bread who survived the longest - and who offered proof that everything can be taken away from us except the ability to choose our attitude in any given set of circumstances.
              Frankl came to believe that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. This outstanding work offers us all a way to transcend suffering and find significance in the art of living.

            <h3>The Psychology of Money By Morgan Housel</h3>
            <p>Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.
